This is an AOT compatible version of the cool angular2-color-picker by Alberplz.

In future this library might merge with the angular2-color-picker or continue live as a seprate library.

More info about library usage see the README of the angular2-color-picker for now.

See a live example application <a href="https://zefoy.github.io/ngx-color-picker/">here</a>.
