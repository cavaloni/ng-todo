You just include the excanvas script like this:\n\n```html\n<!--[if lte IE 8]><script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"excanvas.min.js\"></script><![endif]-->\n```\n\nIf it's not working on your development IE 6.0, check that it has\nsupport for VML which Excanvas is relying on. It appears that some\nstripped down versions used for test environments on virtual machines\nlack the VML support.\n\nYou can also try using [Flashcanvas][flashcanvas], which uses Flash to\ndo the emulation. Although Flash can be a bit slower to load than VML,\nif you've got a lot of points, the Flash version can be much faster\noverall. Flot contains some wrapper code for activating Excanvas which\nFlashcanvas is compatible with.\n\nYou need at least jQuery 1.2.6, but try at least 1.3.2 for interactive\ncharts because of performance improvements in event handling.\n\n\n## Basic usage ##\n\nCreate a placeholder div to put the graph in:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"placeholder\"></div>\n```\n\nYou need to set the width and height of this div, otherwise the plot\nlibrary doesn't know how to scale the graph. You can do it inline like\nthis:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"placeholder\" style=\"width:600px;height:300px\"></div>\n```\n\nYou can also do it with an external stylesheet. Make sure that the\nplaceholder isn't within something with a display:none CSS property -\nin that case, Flot has trouble measuring label dimensions which\nresults in garbled looks and might have trouble measuring the\nplaceholder dimensions which is fatal (it'll throw an exception).\n\nThen when the div is ready in the DOM, which is usually on document\nready, run the plot function:\n\n```js\n$.plot($(\"#placeholder\"), data, options);\n```\n\nHere, data is an array of data series and options is an object with\nsettings if you want to customize the plot. Take a look at the\nexamples for some ideas of what to put in or look at the \n[API reference](API.md). Here's a quick example that'll draw a line \nfrom (0, 0) to (1, 1):\n\n```js\n$.plot($(\"#placeholder\"), [ [[0, 0], [1, 1]] ], { yaxis: { max: 1 } });\n```\n\nThe plot function immediately draws the chart and then returns a plot\nobject with a couple of methods.\n\n\n## What's with the name? ##\n\nFirst: it's pronounced with a short o, like \"plot\". Not like \"flawed\".\n\nSo \"Flot\" rhymes with \"plot\".\n\nAnd if you look up \"flot\" in a Danish-to-English dictionary, some of\nthe words that come up are \"good-looking\", \"attractive\", \"stylish\",\n\"smart\", \"impressive\", \"extravagant\". One of the main goals with Flot\nis pretty looks.\n\n\n## Notes about the examples ##\n\nIn order to have a useful, functional example of time-series plots using time\nzones, date.js from [timezone-js][timezone-js] (released under the Apache 2.0\nlicense) and the [Olson][olson] time zone database (released to the public\ndomain) have been included in the examples directory.  They are used in\nexamples/axes-time-zones/index.html.\n\n\n[excanvas]: http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/\n[flashcanvas]: http://code.google.com/p/flashcanvas/\n[timezone-js]: https://github.com/mde/timezone-js\n[olson]: http://ftp.iana.org/time-zones\n",
